## 2026-03-10 — Jest 29 → 30

**Files changed:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
**Platforms / modules affected:** All target projects that have installed PlanVisualizer via `scripts/install.sh`
**What changed:** `jest` devDependency version `29.7.0` → `30.x`
**Why:** Eliminates `inflight@1.0.6` and `glob@7` deprecation warnings from transitive dependencies.
**Adaptations completed:** Updated in PlanVisualizer repo.
**Adaptations still needed:** Target projects that ran `install.sh` before 2026-03-10 still have `jest@29` in their `package.json`. They should run `npm install jest@30 --save-dev` to update.

## 2026-03-10 — plan-visualizer.config.json committed to this repo

**Files changed:** `.gitignore` (removal of `plan-visualizer.config.json` entry), new `plan-visualizer.config.json`
**Platforms / modules affected:** PlanVisualizer repo only — does not affect target project installations (their .gitignore is set up separately by install.sh)
**What changed:** Config file now tracked in PlanVisualizer's own repo for self-documentation and plan-visualizer.yml workflow
**Adaptations completed:** Done.
**Adaptations still needed:** None.
